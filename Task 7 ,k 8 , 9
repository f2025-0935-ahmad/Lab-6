Task 7 :

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    string password;
    while(true){
        cout << "Enter the password :";
        cin >> password;
        if (password == "Phyton123"){
            cout << "Access granted" << endl;
            break;
        }else{
              cout << "Wrong Password Try Again" << endl;
              
            }
        
    
    }
    return 0;
}

Task 8 :
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int number;
    bool isPrime = true;

    cout << "Enter a number: ";
    cin >> number;

    if (number <= 1)

                break;
            }
        }
    }

    if (isPrime)
        cout << "The number is prime.";
    else
        cout << "The number is not prime.";

    return 0;

Task 9 :


Step 1) You are developing a movie theater booking system where customers can see the seat arrangement before selecting their seats. The theater has R rows and C columns, where each seat is represented by its row and seat number in the format (row-seat). Write a C++ program using nested for loops to generate a seat layout, where each seat is displayed as (row-seat).



#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int R, C;

    cout << "Enter number of rows: ";
    cin >> R;

    cout << "Enter number of seats in each row: ";
    cin >> C;

    cout << "\nSeat layout:\n";

    for (int i = 1; i <= R; i++) {       
        for (int j = 1; j <= C; j++) {   
            cout << "(" << i << "-" << j << ") ";
        }
        cout << endl; 
    }

    return 0;
}


Step 2) Create a booking system, which helps to reserve seats and after every reservation, show a map of reservations and available seats.


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int rows, cols;
    cin >> rows >> cols;
    char seats[10][10];

    for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++)
        for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++)
            seats[i][j] = 'A';

    while (true) {
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++)
                cout << seats[i][j] << " ";
            cout << endl;
        }

        int r, c;
        cin >> r;
        if (r == 0) break;
        cin >> c;

        if (seats[r-1][c-1] == 'A') seats[r-1][c-1] = 'B';
        else cout << "Already booked\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
